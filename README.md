its a sand box for myself who solve the lyfoes game inspired by https://github.com/jgraham909/lyfoes-solver

my goal is to make an algorythme who can run on mind 

-main2 is the main programe

-level is the module who return the selected level called "columns"
the var level line 19 change sthe selected level on the switch case
on switch(level) we can add an other level
case "dificulty"."level"
on the column we take color who are translate on number for the rest
if we un// verify() at the last line it can run alone for test an new level

-bigball is the module who count howmany same ball above the botle
2 ball can move on one time
it kill some infinit loop

-column is just for keep pompatibility to the other solver

-emptyBotle get only one empty bolte 
//it just reduce the posibility

-move is the function who move a ball from a botle to an other
it move the bigball

-nextMove2 show what move can we do
it take count of the big ball
